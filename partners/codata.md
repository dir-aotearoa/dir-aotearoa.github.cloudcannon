**[CODATA](https://www.codata.org/)** is the Committee on Data of
the **[International Science Council](https://council.science/) ([ISC](https://council.science/))**.
CODATA exists to promote global collaboration to improve the availability
and usability of data for all areas of research. CODATA supports the
principle that data produced by research and susceptible to be used for
research should be as open as possible and as closed as necessary.

CODATA works also to advance the interoperability and the usability of such data: research data should be **[intelligently open](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/report/)** or **[FAIR](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/pdf/fair_eg.pdf)**. By promoting the policy, technological and cultural changes that are essential to promote Open Science, CODATA helps advance ISC’s vision and mission of advancing science as a global public good.[](https://codata.org/home)

The **CODATA Strategic Plan** identifies three priority areas:
1. promoting principles, policies and practices for Open Data and Open Science; 
2. advancing the frontiers of data science;
3. building capacity for Open Science by improving data skills and the functions of national science systems needed to support open data.

CODATA achieves these objectives through a number of **[standing committees and strategic executive led initiatives](https://codata.org/initiatives/strategic-programme/)**, and through its **[Task Groups](https://codata.org/initiatives/task-groups/)** and **[Working Groups](https://codata.org/working-groups).**  CODATA supports the **[Data Science Journal](http://datascience.codata.org/)** and collaborates on major data conferences like **[SciDataCon](http://www.scidatacon.org/2016/)** and **[International Data Week](http://internationaldataweek.org/)**
