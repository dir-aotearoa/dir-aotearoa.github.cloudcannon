### RDA builds the social and technical bridges to enable the open sharing and re-use of data.

The Research Data Alliance (RDA) was launched as a community-driven initiative in 2013 by the European Commission, the United States Government's National Science Foundation and National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Australian Government’s Department of Innovation with the goal of building the social and technical infrastructure to enable open sharing and re-use of data.

RDA has a grass-roots, inclusive approach covering all data lifecycle stages, engaging data producers, users and stewards, addressing data exchange, processing, and storage. It has succeeded in creating the neutral social platform where international research data experts meet to exchange views and to agree on topics including social hurdles on data sharing, education and training challenges, data management plans and certification of data repositories, disciplinary and interdisciplinary interoperability, as well as technological aspects.

The RDA Foundation provides the core business operations of RDA and represents RDA globally. [Learn more.](https://www.rd-alliance.org/about-rda/rda-foundation)

### The RDA Vision and Mission 

* The RDA Vision: Researchers and innovators openly share and re-use data across technologies, disciplines, and countries to address the grand challenges of society.
* The RDA Mission: RDA builds the social and technical bridges that enable open sharing and re-use of data.### RDA Guiding Principles
* **Openness** – Membership is open to all interested individuals who subscribe to the RDA’s Guiding Principles. RDA community meetings and processes are open, and the deliverables of RDA Working Groups will be publicly disseminated.
* **Consensus** – The RDA moves forward by achieving consensus among its membership. RDA processes and procedures include appropriate mechanisms to resolve conflicts.
* **Inclusivity**– The RDA seeks to promote broad, balanced and inclusive representation of its membership and stakeholder communities.
* **Harmonization** – The RDA works to achieve harmonization across data standards, policies, technologies, infrastructure, and communities.
* **Community-driven** – The RDA is a public, community-driven body constituted of volunteer members and organizations, supported by the RDA Secretariat.
* **Non-profit and technology-neutral** - RDA does not promote, endorse, or sell commercial products, technologies, or services and the development of open and re-usable recommendations and outputs within the RDA is mandatory.

### RDA Working and Interest Groups

RDA addresses the need for open and interoperable sharing of research data and builds the social, technical and cross-disciplinary links to enable such sharing on a global scale.

**RDA Members come together through focused [Working Groups and Interest Groups](https://rd-alliance.org/groups/), formed by experts from all around the world – from academia, private sector and government**. Participation in RDA is open to anyone who agrees to its [guiding principles](https://rd-alliance.org/get-involved.html) of openness, consensus, inclusivity and harmonisation, with a community-driven, non-profit and technology-neutral approach.

### RDA Communities of Practice

In an effort to build discipline or domain specific communities, the RDA introduced [Communities of Practice (CoP)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/creating-and-managing-rda-groups/creating-or-joining-rda-community-practice) to its membership in December 2020. CoPs investigate, discuss and provide knowledge and skills within a specific discipline and/or research domain. Composed of experts from that area, CoPs are committed to directly or indirectly enabling data sharing, exchange and/or interoperability by serving as THE coordination focal point for RDA in those specific disciplines/research domains.

### RDA Recommendations and Outputs

[RDA Outputs](https://rd-alliance.org/recommendations-outputs) are the technical and social infrastructure solutions developed by RDA Working Groups or Interest Groups that enable data sharing, exchange, and interoperability. They have an important impact on:
* Solving data sharing problems
* Adoption in infrastructure environments by individuals, projects and organisations

To improve global data sharing, exchange and interoperability, RDA works on raising awareness and expanding the adoption of these outputs across all regions of the world.
